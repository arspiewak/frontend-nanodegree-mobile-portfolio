# resize-images:  A shell script to resize/compress image files.

# Image processing through ImageMagick uses the smartresize function
# defined in .bashrc (source credited in README.md). smartresize is
# based on ImageMagick's mogrify command. mogrify is designed for
# processing multiple files, but we use it because of a documented
# bug in the convert command. Files are processed one at a time so
# we can control renaming different sized outputs from the same
# source.

# Define smartresize the same way that an interactive session does
source ~/.bashrc

# Create the destination directories if not there.
